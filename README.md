Authz0 is an automated authorization test tool. Unauthorized access can be identified based on URLs and Roles & Credentials.

URLs and Roles are managed as YAML-based templates, which can be automatically created and added through authz0. You can also test based on multiple authentication headers and cookies with a template file created/generated once.
